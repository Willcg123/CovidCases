To run this project open the CodeAndData folder and create a database in SQL and import the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccines excels into a database. I named mine PortfolioProject. Then open the SQL Query to observe the variables I looked at and how I used them. Then I used some of these queries and exported them into a excel sheet to upload on Tableau and created a dashboard which can also be found in the CodeAndData folder.
